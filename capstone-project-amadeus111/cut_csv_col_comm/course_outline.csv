"This course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in COMP3511 – Human Computer Interaction. The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces. "

"The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions."

"The course focuses on legal and regulatory aspects of the Internet and related technologies. It covers topics of concern toindividuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment,electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse theimpact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translatedinto the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. Itis the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter andanalyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability ofcyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractualterms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read intoa contract to download software.A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judgesare to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles]that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who failto understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, andmay overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.Main Topics<ul><li>Introduction to the Internet and related technologies</li><li>Information technology patents</li><li>Translation</li><li>Electronic contracts</li><li>Computer and information security</li><li>Cyber crime: Law and enabling technologies</li></ul>"

"The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions."

"To meet the demands of today’s competitive marketplace, enterprise processes must be lean and customer focussed. This course looks at ways in which business processes can be analysed, redesigned, and improved thus ensuring that they are meeting the needs of customers and the enterprise. A business process is a set of related activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organisations. Business process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, improvement, management, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes that deliver lean and customer focused business processes. BPM includes process modelling that explicitly represents processes – once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to manage business process."
"This is a Level 3 Information Systems (IS) course that concludes the students’ study of IS through the application, integration and synthesis of students’ knowledge from previous IS courses. Specifically, INFS3605 is the ‘capstone’ IS course that is centrally organised around practical, experiential, group software projects. Throughout the course, students will apply programming knowledge and teamwork skills learnt in previous courses in an applied and integrated fashion. The course begins with student groups brainstorming and developing their software project ideas and then gathering requirements. Following this, student groups engage in an iterative development process in designing and refining their software application. Specifically, students will use the agile scrum framework in developing their software project, working in two-week sprints/iterations. This hands-on project course takes a blended approach to learning, mixing online content provided through the school’s e-learning platform (Moodle) with weekly flipped workshop sessions. Throughout the course, students will perform various roles (including scrum master and product owner) and ceremonies (including sprint planning, stand-up sessions, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives and backlog refinement), as well as utilise a number of a tools (such as kanban boards, burndown charts and planning poker).Overall, this capstone project course requires students to apply, integrate and build upon existing knowledge and skills learnt in previous IS courses.

"The course focuses on legal and regulatory aspects of the Internet and related technologies. It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.  The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractual terms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read into a contract to download software.A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.Main Topics<ul><li>Introduction to the Internet and related technologies</li><li>Information technology patents</li><li>Translation</li><li>Electronic contracts</li><li>Computer and information security</li><li>Cyber crime: Law and enabling technologies</li></ul>"

"Operations research - a topic conceived in the Second World War by the US military - is the science of understanding and analysing problems to come up with a recommended course of action. It mimics the Military Appreciation Process. This course carries on from the course entitled 'Operations Research' and trains students on the selection of appropriate techniques by describing the strengths and weaknesses of models and simulation, so that fit-for-purpose methods are applied to soluble problems. It will cover the algorithms used to solve hard OR problems including linear programming, transportation, assignment, integer programming, computational complexity including the theory of NP-completeness, combinatorial optimisation, nonlinear optimisation, dynamic programming, goal programming, multi-objective optimisation, and heuristics."
"      This course provides a foundation in modelling dynamics of engineering systems and leads to solution of practical problems in vibration and automatic control. Free body diagrams and energy methods will be shown. Solution of free and forced response will be investigated. Basic vibration analysis will be used to apply vibration isolation methods. Multiple degree of freedom systems including lumped parameter systems will be introduced leading to the eigenvalue problem and modal analysis. The course will enable students to design effective feedback control using a broad range of control design tools including mathematical modelling of system components, block diagram manipulation, linearisation, Laplace transform, root locus, frequency domain and state space techniques. Students will study practical controllers such as the PID controller.    "

"Cyber-security is headline news and a growing challenge for national and global security, while computer technology now pervades every aspect of the personal and professional lives of our graduates. This technology underpins enormous performance improvements but also brings serious vulnerabilities. The many forms of cyber-threats - such as data theft, surveillance, and system compromise - have become tools of activism, corporate and state espionage, warfare, counter-proliferation, and intelligence gathering. This course provides an in-depth introduction to the strategic and national security challenges of cybersecurity, and provides students with the skills to defend their organisation and their personal computers from the most common forms of attack."
