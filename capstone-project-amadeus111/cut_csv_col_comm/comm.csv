In order to analyse theimpact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translatedinto the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. Itis the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter andanalyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability ofcyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractualterms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read intoa contract to download software.A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judgesare to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles]that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another.

Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are fk*polyn for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization preprocessing.

It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.  The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractual terms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read into a contract to download software.A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.Main TopicsulliIntroduction to the Internet and related technologies/liliInformation technology patents/liliTranslation/liliElectronic contracts/liliComputer and information security/liliCyber crime: Law and enabling technologies/li/ul",Faculty of Law,None,Term 1,http://timetable.unsw.edu.au/2019/LAWS3131.html,arrangement:T1:School Office

It will cover the algorithms used to solve hard OR problems including linear programming, transportation, assignment, integer programming, computational complexity including the theory of NP-completeness, combinatorial optimisation, nonlinear optimisation, dynamic programming, goal programming, multi-objective optimisation, and heuristics.",UNSW Canberra at ADFA,Study Level,Semester 2,http://timetable.unsw.edu.au/2019/ZEIT3406.html,arrangement:Z2:Prof R  Sarker

Free body diagrams and energy methods will be shown. Solution of free and forced response will be investigated. Basic vibration analysis will be used to apply vibration isolation methods. Multiple degree of freedom systems including lumped parameter systems will be introduced leading to the eigenvalue problem and modal analysis. The course will enable students to design effective feedback control using a broad range of control design tools including mathematical modelling of system components, block diagram manipulation, linearisation, Laplace transform, root locus, frequency domain and state space techniques. Students will study practical controllers such as the PID controller.    ",UNSW Canberra at ADFA,Study Level,Semester 1,http://timetable.unsw.edu.au/2019/ZEIT3502.html,arrangement:Z1:Dr SG Anavatti
